You need to turn the string into a URL, then put the URL into an URLRequest, and WKWebView will load that.

This is a feature from the Safari browser that many users rely on, so it's nice to keep it around.

    // 3) looping through sites in out safe list placing the name of the site in the website variable
    // 4) we use contains() String method to see whether each safe site exists somewhere in the host name
    // 5) if the website was found than we call decision handler with a positive response - we want to allow loading
